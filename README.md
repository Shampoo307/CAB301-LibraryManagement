# CAB301-LibraryManagement

Console application to manage a library's DVDs and users (University assignment).
DVDs are stored in a DVD collection, through implementation of a binary search tree.
Members are stored in a Member collection.
Members can be added and removed, borrow and return DVDs, view a list of all DVDs in the system,
and through use of an author-created algorithm view the top 10 most borrowed DVDs .
The staff member on login can add and remove members and DVDs, and perform a lookup for a member's phone number using their name.
